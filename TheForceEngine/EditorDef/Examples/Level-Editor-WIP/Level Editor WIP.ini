Description {
Level editor WIP demonstration project - Mining Facility
============================================================
Top Secret Imperial Mining Facility on the moon Valgara VII.
Activity spiked at this facility several months ago, and
our agents inside indicate the Empire has finally discovered
a rare element long hypothesized to exist but, until now,
never found at their secret facility on Valgara VII. If
theory is to be believed, this may be the key the Empire
needs to wipe out all resistance in the galaxy.
You must infiltrate the base, retrieve the Phrik metal,
and return to your ship. You must succeed at all costs. Be
warned, the mines run deep and are confusing to navigate.
Be sure to stock up on batteries and use your headlamp in
dark areas (F5 by default).
------------------------------------------------------------
The level was created throughout development so some
areas may be outdated, for example some objects may have
entities that are not correctly categorized.
This level was made entirely using the TFE Level Editor,
except for supporting material - such as the screenshot.
